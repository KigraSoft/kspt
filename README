KigraSoft Simple Profile Tool (kspt)

kspt is just a simple and quick way to profile different computers.
Depending on the situation, I tend to bounce between various computers
and I am often currious of the relevent performance of the computers.
The initial version is primarily focused on CPU performance and
perhaps some memory performance also.

To build and run from the git repo:
  > autoreconf --install
  > ./configure CFLAGS='-O0'
  > make
  > src/kspt
